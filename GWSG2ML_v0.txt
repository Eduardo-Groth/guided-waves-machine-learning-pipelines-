hello everyone
***it works with Abaqus and Matlab ******** 
this is the v0 realese of the GWSG2ML
*********************************************
Guide Wave Generator too Machine Learnig 
*********************************************
how this script works
-it create a model with randomic position of defects
-excitated a guided wave in this model 
-acquire signal for p√≥s proces 
v0 realese
model: strip 2D (shell)
defects: circular holes 
signal acquire: one point close to the end of the strip
********************************************
instructions to use:
- the interface is in the main.m 

the user can set:
excitation direction and amplitud
tone burst frequency and number of cycle 
acquires frequency 
size and numbers of defects
